Hi, my name is <strong>Giovanni</strong> (aka giannuzzo), I've been a programmer since I was 14 (2014). During my educational career I have learned many programming languages such as <strong>Java, C, C++, C#, etc...</strong> I have experimented with development areas such as <strong>video games, native mobile applications, minecraft plugins, desktop applications and server applications</strong>. During the lockdown period (Italy) I discovered the existence of flutter and dart, it didn't take long for them to become my favourite framework and programming language (along with NodeJs).

I'm an <strong>open-source</strong> lover and I really enjoy working in teams.
I am currently a Software Engineer at <a href="https://jagaad.it">Jagaad</a>.

ðŸ’» <strong>My Strong Skills:</strong> Java, JavaScript, Flutter, Dart, Kotlin, Python, PHP<br/>
